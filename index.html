        		<h1>Installing Suse Enterprise 15_SP1 TRIAL</h1>
				<p>These were the actual processes I went through

                    1. Start the installation with new VM with 90-GB Hard disk for Main OS <i>(SUSE Enterprise Linux 15 SP1)</i> and HANA express. 16-GB ram. If 16 or less than 16-GB we need to add 20GB of <b>/SWAP</b>.
                
                    2. Go to <link rel="stylesheet" href="suse.com"> and register for 60 days trial and get the KEY or skipping for later registration in yast. We need this for latest updates.
                    
                    3. Download <b>GM1.DVD for SUSE for SAP 15 SP1.</b> and boot into the installer and select INSTALL. <i>(with f3 you change the display mode because for me the screen was way too small to read and interact)</i>
                    
                    4. Setup the Network as required by clicking the Network Config on the top right side. I have setup the static ip <b>172.16.0.20/24</b> iPV4 with <b>172.16.0.254</b> as a default gateway and hostname to <i>susehana.example.local</i>
                    
                    5. If we selected SAP installation at the start and registered in the previous step it will fetch the modules online. 
                    
                    6. In the next step we can use the guided or we can go with Expert mode, which I did.
                    
                    7. Use LVM for all except BIOS BOOT.
                        a. Create a new vghana of 90 GB
                        b. Create lvmain 500 MB
                        c. Create lvboot 69.50 GB
                        d. Create lvswap 20 GB
                    
                    8. Use 4Mib for BIOS boot <i>(already selected)</i>
                    
                    9. Create new partitions as following:-
                        a. 500 MiB for / 
                        b. 69.50 GiB for /boot
                        c. 20 GiB for /SWAP
                    
                    10. Now in the next window we need to add the root password <i>( we will create a separate user "sapadm" as a local sudo admin later )</i>
                    
                    11. Install with GUI or TEXT-mode <i>(which I prefer)</i>
                    
                    12. Change the SSH from closed to open <i>( so we can use ssh later )</i>
                    
                    13. Kdump is enabled
                    
                    14. Now let it install and wait for few minutes.
                    
                    15. Now log into new system and add a user "sapadm" for SAP Administration and general OS administration. Add "sapadm" into visudo file under the root ALL=<i>(ALL:ALL)</i> ALL, with same options as root.
                    
                    16. OPTIONAL - SSH - KEY you can do this optionally
                        a. Change to user "sapadm" and mkdir .ssh and chmod 0700
                        b. Create new authorized_keys file via vim chmod it 0644 and add your host id_rsa.pub which is public ssh keys so you can use Putty or WSL2 Ubuntu instance to connect <i>( I used WSL2-Ubuntu on Windows Terminal - I like the fonts and overall aesthetics of this terminal  but you can use whatever you like)</i>
                    Donâ€™t forget to restart ssh with systemctl restart sshd</a></p>
